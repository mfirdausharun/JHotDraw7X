<p>JHotDraw 8 is a framework for structured drawing editors. 
It can be used to create many different editors from a simple doodle
program up to full fledged diagram editors and vector animation tools.</p>

<p>JHotDraw 8 differs significantly from JHotDraw 7 in the following aspects:</p>
<ul>
    <li>JHotDraw 8 is based on JavaFX whereas JHotDraw 7 is based on Swing.</li>
    <li>In JHotDraw 8 the Figure objects are passive and need to be explicitly updated to get
        into a consistent state. In JHotDraw 7 the Figure objects actively maintain a
        consistent state. This passive designs allows to greatly improve
    the performance of the drawing editor.</li>
    <li>In JHotDraw 8 a Drawing has layers and supports styling with CSS.
    These features are not supported in JHotDraw 7.</li>
</ul>
